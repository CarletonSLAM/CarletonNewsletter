Many engineers seeking to enter the space industry lack insight on project life cycle phases that may impede the project process and aptness to meet both requirements and deadlines. In this talk, we will go over the different phases that compose Project Life Cycle. This presentation will provide an overview of each phase, including: Concept Studies, Concept and Technology Development, Preliminary Design and Technology Completion, Final Design and Fabrication, System Assembly, Integration and Test, Launch, Operations and Sustainment, and Closeout. The presentation will conclude with an outlook of future technologies for space exploration and settlement.
