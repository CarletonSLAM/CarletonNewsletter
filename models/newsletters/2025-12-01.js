The 17th Annual Celebration of Women in Engineering Wine & Cheese provides an opportunity for the industry to connect to students in engineering and science who are seeking to expand their network and spark valuable discussions in a low-pressure environment. Academia, industry, and students are invited to meet others over refreshments and create lasting connections for years to come.

Our team is focused on connecting passionate and motivated individuals with the opportunities that will help them make an impact. We believe that getting creative and intellectual people to the places that they can excel is essential in building a sustainable and innovative future.`,
