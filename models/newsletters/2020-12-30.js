It will drive economic expansion in many sectors, spawn new products and services, and transform our lives as we know it. Yet, before 5G can deliver on its promises and quality of service (QoS) metrics, wireless systems designers and engineers must overcome sizable challenges. Ansys 5G simulation solutions empower these individuals to solve the complexities impeding device, network and data center design. Ansys 5G simulation solutions provide electromagnetics, semiconductor, electronics cooling and mechanical analysis tools to accurately simulate 5G radio and related technologies. The multi-solution platform leverages high-performance computing that can be deployed across the enterprise, allowing designers and engineering experts to collaborate more effectively.`
