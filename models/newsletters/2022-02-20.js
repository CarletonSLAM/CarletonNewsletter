LeNet inspired a myriad of advancements in Deep Learning and led to many more renowned CNN-based architectures. In this project-based workshop, we invite you to join us in recreating the LeNet architecture using the MNIST database of handwritten digits and explore the many design changes that could improve classification accuracy.`
