Our AI Coffee hour is a social event where everyone is invited to bring a cup of coffee and chat with the CAIS members about anything relating to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Want to exchange where you get your AI news and research? Feeling good or need help with your personal AI project? This is the perfect place to meet fellow AI enthusiasts. The discussions will be lightly guided by new themes every week, but nothing AI-related is off-limits. No prior experience or knowledge is required.

This week we‚Äôll be discussing scary and unethical applications of AI/ML for Halloween!`

The goal is to use an object‚Äôs features to determine which class or category it belongs to. In this workshop, we introduce the notion of linear classifiers to make such predictions. In particular, we will go over a popular machine learning model called logistic regression. We will explain how this model works and the various problems it can be applied to. Similar to the linear regression workshop, knowledge of calculus and linear algebra is beneficial to understand the technical details but not required to get an overall idea of how linear classification works.`
