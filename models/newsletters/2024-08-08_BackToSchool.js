                has been a diverse group of students at Carleton interested in engineering, computer science and other
                technical fields! We are a smaller community within the IEEE Ottawa Branch and host numerous social events
                throughout the year at Carleton and across the Greater Ottawa Region. No- you do not have to be in engineering to join!
                So, if you know people who are interested in being a part of a tight-knit group we are always ready to welcome in new members.
                Feel free to share this newsletter with your friends as well!`
