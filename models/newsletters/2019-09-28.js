This month IEEE WIE Carleton and CSES hosted a Speaker Panel featuring 4 women in STEM from Nokia, Iversoft, Kott Group, and Magnet Forensics. The event was very successful as we achieved our goal having 45 people come out! This couldn't have happened without the WIE Vice-Chair, Marie, and Cameron, the CSES Academics Director. WIE is also in the works of planning a hack with Magnet Forensics, planning a social event, collaborating with other clubs, and we have started planning for our annual Wine and Cheese!`

Without the help I received from my fellow execs, workshop instructors, volunteers, and participants, these workshops would not have reached their full potential. So, I would like to give a big shout out to you all for making these workshops enjoyable, fun, and providing an opportunity for everyone to learn. Before I conclude, I just want to say this: ‚ÄúKnowledge should be shared not contain‚Äù and my goal is to make this statement true by creating the environment and events for everyone to learn.`
